# This is a robotic motion planning package written in modern C++ with a focus on OO degin principles. 
The purpose of this package is to provide:

1. A method in which to GenerateMap random maps for which a robot will plan traversal
2. Several algorithms implementations to traverse the maps given above

## Why use this package over other implementations
This package is a work-in-progress and not meant to be a drop-in solution to robotic motion planning. Currently the capabilities offered by this package are **far** exceeded by those [commonly availible and heavily used](http://wiki.ros.org/navigation).  It is not the Author's intent to have this be a general purpose solution to robotic motion planning.
