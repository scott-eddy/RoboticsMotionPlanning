# This is a robotic motion planning package written in modern C++ with a focus on OO design principles. 
The purpose of this package is to provide:

1. A method that generates random maps that a simulated robot will plan to traverse 
2. Several path planning algorithm implementations 

## Why use this package over other implementations
###Don't!

This package is a work-in-progress and not meant to be a solution to robotic motion planning in general. Currently the capabilities offered by this package are **far** exceeded by those [commonly availible and heavily used](http://wiki.ros.org/navigation).
